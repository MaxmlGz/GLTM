This code implements the Bayesian method and reproduces the experiment in 

     I. Valera and Z. Ghahramani, 
     "Automatic Discovery of the Statistical Types of Variables in a Dataset", 
     34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017). Sydney (Australia), 2017.

This version contains a private (MF owned) python wrapper that enables usage in python 3. This is a fairly extensive C++
re-write of the original code. To use the wrapper:

1. Go to `Ccode/wrapper_python` 
2. Follow the instructions therein (includes installing various packages and whatnot)
